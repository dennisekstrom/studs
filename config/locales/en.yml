      title: Get to know 27 new engineers!
      body_html: >
        StuDs, or Datasektionen's study tour, is a unique opportunity to
        meet a bunch of Computer-Science students from on the verge to
        become Master graduates. StuDs offers a great way to meet possible
        future employees.
      title2: Who are we?
      body2_html: >
        StuDs 2013 consists of 27 students at the Master of Science in Computer
        Engineering programme at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). We
        are all studying our fourth or fifth year of the program, hence we
        would like to get in contact with IT companies and soon start our
        future careers. Together, we are a group with a large set of
        knowledge/skills, dreams and interests, however, what we have in common
        is that through StuDs 2013 we hope to meet a lot of exciting companies
        to find either employment or a place for the final degree project.

      body_html: >
        Last year the 2012 year's StuDs project group got to know and
        visited more than 20 different IT companies and the project ended
        with a fantastic trip to San Francisco where interesting companies
        such as Google, Facebook and GitHub were visited during a two
        weeks period.

      quote1: >
        The prosperous IT climate in Stockholm seems to me to be another
        verification that our position, timing and choice of education all
        “align”. During the last year we've visited big broad consulting
        firms as well as small front edge product companies, some refined
        IT businesses but also others where IT is an important complement
        to their core activity. It feels very exciting to become part of an
        industry with such broad possibilities no matter what your personal
        interests or orientations are.

      quote2: >
        The first stop was at Stanford University, one of the world's
        leading research and teaching institutions, and today, over 8,000
        students are performing graduate studies there. We started the tour
        with a walk around the campus grounds. Some of the things we saw
        were the Stanford Memorial Church and the newly laid class plaque
        for the class of 2012.
